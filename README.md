## General Information
-A bike-sharing system offers bikes for shared use on a short-term basis, either for a fee or for free. Many systems use computer-controlled docks where users enter payment information to unlock a bike, which can then be returned to any other dock in the same system.

BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, has experienced significant revenue declines due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The company is struggling to remain viable in the current market conditions. To address this, BoomBikes aims to develop a strategic business plan to quickly boost revenue once the lockdown ends and the economy recovers.

To achieve this, BoomBikes seeks to understand the anticipated demand for shared bikes post-quarantine. They plan to use this information to better serve customers, distinguish themselves from competitors, and increase profits.

BoomBikes has hired a consulting firm to analyze the factors influencing the demand for shared bikes in the American market. They aim to identify:

The variables that significantly predict bike-sharing demand.
How well these variables explain demand fluctuations.
The consulting firm has compiled an extensive dataset on daily bike demands across the American market, taking into account various factors including meteorological conditions and consumer behaviors.

Business Goal: You are tasked with modeling the demand for shared bikes using the available independent variables. This model will help management understand how different features impact demand, allowing them to adjust business strategies accordingly to meet customer needs. Additionally, the model will provide insights into the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
The demand for bikes depends primarily on the following variables:

Year (yr)
Holiday
Season (Spring)
Weather conditions (Mist/Cloudy, Light rain/Light snow/Thunderstorm)
Specific months (March, May, June, August, September, October)
Day of the week (Sunday)
Observations:

Demand increases during the months of March, May, June, August, September, and October, as well as in the specific year analyzed.
Demand decreases on holidays, during spring, in light rain/light snow/thunderstorm conditions, mist/cloudy weather, and on Sundays.
Final Recommendations for BoomBikes:

Focus on boosting bike availability and marketing efforts during the high-demand months of March, May, June, August, September, and October.
Develop strategies to counteract the lower demand on holidays, during spring, in adverse weather conditions, and on Sundays.
